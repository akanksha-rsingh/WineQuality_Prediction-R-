# WineQuality_Prediction-R-
In order to decrease the dependence for a winery on wine tasters and create faster wine scores our team has trained a machine learning classification algorithm. Generally, a winery will have limited resources and can only push into market a certain number of wines that they may be testing. Thus, it is important for them to pick the best wines to mass produce and sell. Traditionally, a winery will need to hire wine tasters to grade the quality of their wine. A winery can then choose the best “n” number of wines to mass produce and sell in the market. In order to do this we trained various classification algorithms, however, the best was the random forest algorithm. This resulted in a predicted accuracy score of 91%.  Then, we used the importance function in R to find the top  four important factors in the random forest algorithm. This function measures the classification error (MeanDecreaseAccuracy) and the node impurities (MeanDecreaseGini). What we find is that both methods give the same top four variables of: alcohol, sulphates, volatile acidity, and density. Afterwards, we decided to perform factor analysis.
